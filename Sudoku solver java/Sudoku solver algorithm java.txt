Sudoku solver algorithm:

Input and ouput:
Input - A 9 x 9 matrix is taken in as Sudoku grid. blank spaces are denoted as 0
Output - Final matrix filled with numbers. False is returned if no  solution exists



methods required in java

1. method to check if the number can be placed in the row - validRow

2. Method to check if the number can be placed in the column - ValidCol

3. Method to check if the number can be placed in the 3x3 box - ValidBox
-integer division of row and column of selected cell by 3
-multiply the resulting 2 numbers by 3 
- the new numbers give the starting row and column number of the 3x3 grid of n     selected cell
- create a loop to compare number with 3x3 grid


4. Method to combine above 3 methods - ValidPlace
- returns true if placement is valid for above 3 methods

5.Method to solve board using backtracking and recusrion - SolvePuzzle
- traverse the grid cell by cell to find empty space 
- when empty space is found check space if any of the 9 numbers can be put in tha scpace
- call SolvePuzzle method again to repeat process  (backtracing)
- if solvePuzzle is true after recusrsive backtracing return true
- return false after the loop to traverse numbers 1 to 9 finishes (there are no possible solutions)


6. Method to display board - disBoard
